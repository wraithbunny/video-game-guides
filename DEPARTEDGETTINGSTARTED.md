## Create a New World
### Seed
It's important to avoid biomes in which you won't be able to attack enemies until later in your gameplay. I scouted out some potential seeds and this one has a good starting area.
- Seed: pokies

If you choose a different seed, avoid being in a savanna, desert, taiga or swamp.

### Game Rules
There are only two rules you'll want to change. Keep all of your inventory items when you die because you will die a lot or in different dimensions and it becomes a pain to attempt to retrieve your items. Also, turn off mobGriefing to avoid letting the damage dealt by mobs destroy your buildings.

- Type: /gamerule keepAllInventory true
- Type: /gamerule mobGriefing false

## Starting
Begin playing immediately and do not dally. The first night of the mod pack is a Blood Moon. A Blood Moon will spawn multiple enemies which are more dangerous. Collect:
- Wood
- Gardens
- Food

## Early Goals
- House with crafting bench, furnace, chest and bed built above y = 64
- 3 wool and 3 wood for a bed
- Coal/charcoal for torches
- 13 stone (2 sword + 3 pickaxe + 8 furnace)
- Mine a staircase down to bedrock, stop right above the highest level of bedrock
- Mine all iron, but only use it for now to make either sheers (if you're against killing sheep) or a pickaxe to mine diamond
- 3 iron for pickaxe
- Mine all diamonds
- 3 diamonds for pickaxe
- 23 diamonds for full set of armor (5 helmet + 7 chest + 7 pants + 4 boots)
- Mine all limonite
- 9 limonite for sword and full set of tools (2 sword + 3 pickaxe + 1 shovel + 3 axe); spawns at y = 49 and below
- Enchantment table (1 book + 2 diamonds + 4 obsidian)
- 15 Bookshelves (45 books + 18 wood planks)
- 45 books for the bookshelves (135 paper + 45 leather)
- 135 paper for the books (405 sugar cane)
- Strip mine for sapphire, rosite, jade and amethyst. All of these are rare.
- Use sapphire for sword (2 sapphire)
- Once you have decent gear, you can check out other worlds. Build a teleporter and use realmstones to travel.


## Mobs
Avoid new mobs in the beginning. If you avoid the biomes I mentioned, you still might encounter bugeyes, trolls, cycclopses, etc. Each of these can be defeated with a stone sword in 2-3 hits. Once you have a good weapon and some armor, wait for the next big event or Blood Moon and go out killing mobs. There are a lot of interesting items, but you'll specifically be looking for a realmstone.

## Realms.
There are many realms, but there are 

## Events
Events are useful, but avoid them until you have a set spawn point, tools, weapon(s), armor

## Bosses

## Portal

## Armor
